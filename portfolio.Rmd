## My packages

I've authored several R packages, which are all available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/martinctc):

* [surveytoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/surveytoolbox)
* [tstoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/tstoolbox)
* [rwa](https://www.github.com/martinctc/rwa)
* [textworks](https://www.github.com/martinctc/textworks)
* [zipcodes](https://www.github.com/martinctc/zipcodes)
* [modeltoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/modeltoolbox)
* [gpxtoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/gpxtoolbox)

Most of these packages were to some extent "by-products" of the analysis that I've been doing for the last couple of years, which I decided would have greater value developed into packages. 

In addition, I maintain the following packages as part of my work with Microsoft Viva Insights: 

* [vivainsights - R](https://microsoft.github.io/vivainsights/)
* [vivainsights - Python](https://microsoft.github.io/vivainsights-py/)
* [wpa](https://microsoft.github.io/wpa/)

If you have any comments or questions about these packages, please get in touch - any feedback would be valuable!
