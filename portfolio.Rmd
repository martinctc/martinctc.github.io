## My packages

I've authored several R packages, which are all available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/martinctc):

* [surveytoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/surveytoolbox)
* [tstoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/tstoolbox)
* [rwa](https://www.github.com/martinctc/rwa)
* [textworks](https://www.github.com/martinctc/textworks)
* [zipcodes](https://www.github.com/martinctc/zipcodes)
* [modeltoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/modeltoolbox)

Most of these packages were to some extent "by-products" of the analysis that I've been doing for the last couple of years, which I decided would have greater value developed into packages. If you have any comments or questions about these packages, please get in touch - any feedback would be valuable!
